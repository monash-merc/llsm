# Developer Documentation

This section will provide information for developers interested in contributing
to `llsm` or who want to use `llsm` libraries in their applications. We will
aim to describe:

- Overall `llsm` library architecture
- Introduction to different sub-projects
- Documentation and examples for using `llsm` API
- Guidelines for contributing


Clearly, we don't have any of this yet, so a lot of work needs to be done. For now,
please refer to the [Scaladoc](../../api) if you dare to jump in.
